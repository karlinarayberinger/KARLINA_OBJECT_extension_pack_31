karbytes_0: "What is karbytes (in the context of the monetary economy which substantiates and facilitates ('first world' level) human civilizations)?"

karbytes_1: "In all contexts, karbytes is a collection of public-domain and public-web-hosted digital files which serve as the source code and media files comprising the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com (whose home page is located at the following Uniform Resource Locator: X) and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (whose home page is located at the following Uniform Resource Locator: Y). karbytes also refers to the name of the human-to-cyborg individual who originally created the aforementioned collection of web-hosted digital files. In the context of all 'first world' money systems, karbytes (the aforementioned web-hosted file collection) is a potential source of income for karbytes (the original proprietor of the aforementioned collection of web-hosted files) due to the fact that the home page of each of the two aforementioned websites has a PayPal donation link on it (which enables visitors to those websites to donate a variable sum of money to karbytes zero or more times using PayPal as the facilitator of such gifting transactions)."

karbytes_0: "Where does karbytes get most its money?"

karbytes_1: "karbytes gets most (if not all) of its money from employment and/or government aid and/or (to a more limited extent) donations."

karbytes_0: "Why should a visitor to the aforementioned websites donate money to karbytes via the PayPal donation 'portal' on the home page of either one of those websites (and each of those two home pages refer to the same PayPal account (whose recipient is named 'Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com')? How much money should a donor donate to karbytes one time?"

karbytes_1: "Only people who want to donate money to karbytes and who already have what they think is a surplus of money should donate money to karbytes via the aforementioned PayPal donation link (according to the aforementioned person named karbytes). Such people should donate to karbytes if they want to support karbytes in doing its own scientific research and development of software and media files which comprise current and future components of the aforementioned body of intellectual property referred to in this dialogue as karbytes. (Each donation serves as empirical evidence that karbytes does not live in an economic nor metaphysical vacuum and also pragmatically assists karbytes in being able to pay for its own basic upkeep and creative expansion). karbytes recommends that people with the aforementioned prerequisites donate at least five United States Dollars (i.e. $5.00) to karbytes via the aforementioned PayPal donation link at least one time. karbytes recommmends that donors make each donation to karbytes a 'one time donation' instead of opting to automatically donate to karbytes on a monthly recurring basis (because karbytes wants to be as minimally burdensome to all persons as possible (and donors who opt to make a recurring donation automatically might forget that they set up such a 'subscription' and hence might accidentally drain their monetary savings more than they want to as a consequence of such unanticipated money leaks)."

karbytes_0: "What is the specific Uniform Resource Locator of the karbytes PayPal donation payment page?"

karbytes_1: "User of the World Wide Web may donate money to karbytes using a credit/debit card or by using their own PayPal account's positive balance to send funds to karbytes at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=6CZQQJLS74TN4"
