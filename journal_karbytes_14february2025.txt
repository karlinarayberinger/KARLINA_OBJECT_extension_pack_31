To Whom It May Concern:

I intend for future "micro directories" of the collection of digital files named karbytes to have the following attributes.

0. A window of process completion time which is indefinitely long rather than limited to a maximum of three months for completing the finalization of the respective "micro directory".

1. A lack of there being a public file displaying karbytes' medication dosages and types (except for occasionally documenting information about psychedelic drugs which karbytes is relatively inexperienced with using and ends up using).

2. A lack of public files displaying content which does not pertain to the topics of metaphysics, mathematics, physics, computation, and updates about karbytes' life and health which karbytes thinks is relevant to karbytes' continued oversight and curation of the aforementioned collection of digital files named karbytes.

Sincerely,
karbytes
