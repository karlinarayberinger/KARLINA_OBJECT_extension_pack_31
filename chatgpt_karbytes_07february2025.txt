The following is a plain-text transcript of a conversation between karbytes and ChatGPT-4o which took place on 06_FEBRUARY_2025 at approximately 11:00PM Pacific Standard Time and pertains to the subject of locating files which are downloaded via the Tor browser. (The download location for such files is relatively hidden compared to the download location for files which are downloaded via the Firefox and Chromium web browsers on karbytes' (Ubuntu operating system) machine).

karbytes:

What Unix command should I use to enable nautilus to open the folder directory of where Tor downloads are stored?

ChatGPT:

To open the folder where Tor Browser stores its downloads using Nautilus, you can use the following command:

nautilus ~/Downloads

If Tor Browser uses a different download location:

Open Tor Browser.

Click the hamburger menu (☰) in the top-right corner.

Select Settings.

Scroll to the Downloads section and check where files are being saved.

If the location is different, replace ~/Downloads with the actual path. For example, if Tor saves downloads to a specific directory like:

nautilus ~/.tor-browser/tor-browser/Browser/Downloads/

If you're unsure about the exact path, you can find it with:

find ~ -type d -name "Downloads"

Let me know if you need a more specific location based on your setup!

karbytes:

What is the most likely directory (on a Ubuntu operating system)?

ChatGPT:

On Ubuntu, the Tor Browser typically saves downloads in one of the following directories, depending on how it was installed:

1. If you installed Tor Browser manually (via the official Tor Project website)

The default download location is:

~/Downloads

You can open it using:

nautilus ~/Downloads

2. If you installed Tor Browser via Flatpak

Flatpak apps use a sandboxed environment, so downloads are stored in:

~/Downloads

or


~/.var/app/org.torproject.TorBrowser/data/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/Downloads/

To open it:

nautilus ~/.var/app/org.torproject.TorBrowser/data/TorBrowser-Data/Browser/Downloads/

3. If Tor Browser is running from the extracted archive

If you extracted Tor to a directory like ~/tor-browser, then downloads may be in:

~/tor-browser/Browser/Downloads/

Open it with:

nautilus ~/tor-browser/Browser/Downloads/

4. Check your actual download path

If unsure where Tor Browser is saving files, use:

find ~ -type d -name "Downloads"

or check in Tor Browser Settings:

Open Tor Browser.

Click ☰ (Menu) > Settings.

Scroll to the Downloads section and check the default location.
