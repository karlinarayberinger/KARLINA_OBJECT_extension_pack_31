karbytes: "I had the following idea today: that nature (or at least some emergent property encompassing or emerging from the entire physical universe in which I live) is a self-aware container whose awareness includes a snapshot of every space-time_mass-energy configuration occurring at time_t (where time_t is some 'point' in time along the temporal continuum in which the aforementioned universe and/or multiverse exists as something other than pure nothingness). An implication of such knowledge (emerging from and constituent with some all-encompassing whole (in relation to all noumena and to all phenomena)) is that such knowledge accounts for the placement (and displacement) of all objects (whether those objects are deemed to be physical, virtual, or abstract (from the perspective of some physical entity which renders and processes knowledge))."
