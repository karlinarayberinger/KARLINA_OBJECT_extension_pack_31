karbytes: "I had the following idea today: that nature (or at least some emergent property encompassing or emerging from the entire physical universe in which I live) is a self-aware container whose awareness includes a snapshot of every space-time_mass-energy configuration occurring at time_t (where time_t is some 'point' in time along the temporal continuum in which the aforementioned universe and/or multiverse exists as something other than pure nothingness). An implication of such knowledge (emerging from and constituent with some all-encompassing whole (in relation to all noumena and to all phenomena)) is that such knowledge accounts for the placement (and displacement) of all objects (whether those objects are deemed to be physical, virtual, or abstract (from the perspective of some physical entity which renders and processes knowledge)). What I find to be particularly significant about what I said in the previous sentence (of this paragraph) is the fact that, given the existence of a knowledge base containing global (i.e. universe-wide and/or multiverse-wide) snapshots at every moment in the time period in which the respective multiverse and/or universe exists, that knowledge could also encompass knowledge of how every object represented by every one of those (hypothetically infinitely many) snapshots are related to each other. In order for that knowledge base to account for every relationship between every object in the respective universe or multiverse (and whether or not any of those objects are abstract, virtual (to some degree of virtuality (due to the fact that virtual simulations can take place inside of (relatively physical) virtual simulations in a 'metaphysically nested' manner), physical, or simply noumenal (if not entirely unaccounted for) acording to some physical information processing agent)), there seems for there to be a need for more information processing resources in the form of space, time, mass, and energy (because thoughts themselves are presumed by me to be composed of space, time, matter, and energy (and knowledge seems to be an operating system comprised of multiple simultaneous thoughts)."
